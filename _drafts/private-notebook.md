As recently it came out that evernote free version would
limit to 2 devices.

I am thinking about developing a private notebook system runs in docker or on website. The notebook would be developed with flask, sqlite and bootstrap. There are at least 2 themes.

Mark down and yaml could be used for this notebook.
